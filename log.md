Dr Waqar rechecked the design and made some changes.

# July 27, 2022

Design got almost completed

# July 26, 2022

I started the design of the pipeline.

# July 25, 2022

Due to rain Dr Waqar didn't answer my message. I hope every thing is fine on his side.

# July 22, 2022

I solved the problem and the mandelbrot set is being generated on GPU.

# July 21, 2022

Batool helped me to solve that error in time. The error could be solved using the WebGL 2.0. We only have to use the `canvas.getContext("webgl2")`.

# July 20, 2022

The error was still there and no wonder how I manage to solve it, it was there. I asked Batool and Hania and Dr Waqar too to help me in it. Although Dr Waqar said no on the face, but the other two were humble to help me. But it was too late and my shift was about to be over therefore I keep that thing for next day.

# July 19, 2022

There was some error regarding the version of the WebGL.

# July 18, 2022

The code got completed. It was a pretty hard journey.

# July 15, 2022

I had meeting with Dr Waqar, he suggested me to re-write the code.

# July 14, 2022

The shader problem almost got solve.

# July 13, 2022

The shaders had some problems, therefore I look into it.

# July 8, 2022

I was out of patience with the error and that was taking too much time. I asked Dr Waqar, but the eid has come so the process is halt hopefully he will answer the question after Eid.

# July 7, 2022

Worked on fixing the error and the changing the shaders, because the last shaders I wrote they were showing the black and white image. But I have found a different method to make it colorful. before the error need to be fixed.

# July 6, 2022

That error has not been solved. It is still a problem.

# July 5, 2022

Worked on rewriting the whole thing from scratch, and bowred some code from the regular polygon code, I did previously. Things seems to go pretty well. but there is only one error which I don't know how to fix.

# July 4, 2022

I managed to get some different codes for shaders but they are showing some errors.

# July 1, 2022

The shaders are causing alot of problems with the rendering, and I'm not sure why. I'm working on a fix, but I'm not sure if it will be possible.

# June 30, 2022

Tried different methods to solve the shaders problem.

# June 29, 2022

Tried different methods to solve the shaders problem.

# June 28, 2022

I spent my whole day learning by reading blogs of WebGL to solve the problem of shaders.

# June 27, 2022

The mandelbort set was difficult to generate. First I tried wrong logic to generate the set and playing with the shaders if they work. Multiple and different types of error came, one after another, and I was unable to generate the set. The next problem was how to customize the shaders to color each pixel differnetly. That on was the most difficult problem.

# June 24, 2022

After the regular polygon thing I was assigned to write a simple WebGL program that draws madelbrot set.

# June 23, 2022

The regular polygon thing was completed. Sir looked into it and appreciated the work.

# June 22, 2022

Most part of the regualr polygons was done with html file ready to be used.

# June 21, 2022

Started working on the two task sir gave to me.

# June 20, 2022
